1. Lines 365-368 (loop which iterates over "data" variable) could be moved to Graph class as one of the methods (for example - initializeGraph(), so this will keep the code more clear and will make
  the Graph class more focused on graph-related operations. 
  
2. Line 391 (findRoute) could be moved to Graph class as well. 

3. Lines 109-363 (enormous array with data) could be moved in a separate module (to keep the code clear) or moved to the database - this approach will prevent hardcoding.

4. Instead of directrly using data in the mentioned array, where stations, color of it's line and it's destinations represented as comma-separated strings, we could make a new Station class to operate with.
This will help us to avoid technical debt in the future, for the case when stations-related functionality could be more complex. Stations could be represented as Station class instances, and this will give us
ability to extend this class with new functionality without need to refactor a lot of code. 

5. It's better to add logging system to this code

6. Lines 375-376 could be refactored using destructurization (ex. const { source, destination } = req.body)
